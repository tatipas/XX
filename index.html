                    <p> XX Investments’ services are very niche and are somewhat “behind the scenes” but are critically
                        important and require flawless execution. Companies that have publicly traded securities
                        typically
                        use transfer agents to keep track of the individuals and entities that own their stocks and
                        bonds.
                        The three functions that transfer agents perform include issuing and canceling certificates to
                        reflect changes in stock ownership, acting as an intermediary for the company, and handling
                        lost,
                        destroyed, or stolen stock certificates.

                        in
                        the performance of its duties, transfer agents must be well-structured and organized entities
                        with
                        knowledge resources and capable teams of personnel.XX Investments has established policies and

                        maintain
                        records, and maintain information in a secure and confidential manner. The company has an
                        established relationship in place with the largest crowdfunding platform, Wefunder, for which it
                        serves as a transfer agent.
